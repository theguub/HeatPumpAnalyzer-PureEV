# Thermal Analysis of a Pure EV Heat Pump using CoolProp
The following repository contains two Python scripts utilizing the 'CoolProp' library for a thermal analysis of a Pure Electric Vehicle's HVAC system (Heat Pump). The CoolProp library is helpful in the analysis of an HVAC system as it operates on the thermodynamic cycle known as the 'vapor-compression heat pump/refrigeration cycle', where the CoolProp library helps us quickly find thermodynamic properties of cycles under a set of various parameters. 

# Cold Temperature Analysis
This Python file contains an analysis of the idealized heat pump cycle under an extreme-cold climate. The outside temperature is given as -10 degrees Celcius and the desired cabin temperature, after the heat pump, is 20 degrees Celcius. This analysis provides an insight of the ideal conditions and characteristics of a highly efficient, Pure EV Heat Pump, working on a cold winter day in Chicago.

# Warm Temperature Analysis
This Python file contains an analysis of the idealized heat pump cycle under an extreme-hot climate. The outside temperature is given as 25 degrees Celcius and the desired cabin temperature, after the heat pump, is 20 degrees Celcius. This analysis provides an insight of the ideal conditions and characteristics of a highly efficient, Pure EV Heat Pump, working on a hot summer day in Chicago.
